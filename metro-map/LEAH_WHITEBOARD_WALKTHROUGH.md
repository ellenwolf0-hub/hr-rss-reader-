## Verbatim transcript

"So, like we... we love to plot things. This is multidimensional. There's multiple plots, of course. We've talked about the different ways that one might like grow in their career. Often there's like... things getting more complex. Your scope increasing, like number of direct reports. Maybe that's basically scope. Maybe this is like amount of ambiguity. Like, things just get harder.

Then there's another way you could think about it — this PSHE framework. Early in your career, you're just given a thing to do. Just do the thing and do it well. And you can just get better at doing it well. You can figure out how to execute, how to systematize, how to do the thing. You could then be like, oh, what is actually... I'm going to come up with new solutions. And then identifying the problems. There's a better top track for this.

So you can think about your career going in any different way. Like your classical career ladder is like, I'm going up in scope, I'm going up in complexity, and here I am, CEO of the world. But there's other ways you might go. Maybe you're just going to get executing on something small, then executing on something big, getting bigger and bigger — an execution machine. Maybe I'm getting bigger and bigger and executing, but actually — oh, around here I think I have some ideas on how I want to do that, and it's going to go this way.

Or it's like on this one smaller area, this less complex thing, I'm going to go up the PSHE ladder. And like, maybe the average of all of these things is this kind of S curve. Where people — we talk about this trough of whatever — when you think, oh, if I just go up in scope it'll be more to do, but actually that's going this way, and you want to go up in complexity. So there's all these different ways you could exist in the world and anyone's career might go like... or whatever.

**Where the levels come in** is generally we kind of think about — like our junior level is over here. This is what you're doing. You might go this way, you might go this way, but it's in this area. And then the next level up is this other kind of rainbow here. And then another rainbow. It's this kind of blobby space. So it's not just this ladder — you might... it's like it could be more complexity or it could be more solutions, but this is all here. And then another rainbow. And maybe these aren't necessarily proportional — like this is a smaller band, and this big band is the other one here. **But the levels kind of overlay on this.**

Within each level — look at all these ways you could do anything. And impact looks maybe a little bit different up here than it does down here. But there probably are some things in common — like you're helping the business make money, you're saving money, you're solving your boss's problem. That's consistent. But we aren't going to like... it would be unfair to compare this person to this person, because they just have a different scope and size. But it could be fair to compare people within a level. And it makes sense that those people are all getting paid kind of the same amount of money. **So the levels are an overlay.**

But if I'm a person in a career, I'm thinking really about my squiggle. It's more about making the journey — scribbling all over this — being like, I gotta get up to here. But there might be people who want to get up here, but we show them: if that's where you want to go, you got to work on... You can also have a big fancy level of impact over at execution — like you can go straight across this line and be in that same... like another axis out into the triangle."

**On individual work / dots:**  
"Some of my work falls here. Some of it's over here. Some of it's over here. Some of it's over here. I wonder if there's a way to make it more real — like, on this project, what are we doing? Are we just... I think we're..."

**Brady (coaching):**  
"The part that I like about this is that often a coaching conversation I have — in the trough of despair of the squiggle — people are very focused on how do I get a larger scope, how do I get more direct reports. But they should be figuring out how do I think about the solution more effectively. So a conversation I often have around growth with people is: you need to get reps right now. You did this thing once — great. You need to do it 15 times. And then that enables you to move forward with complexity."

## Build ideas for Cursor

| Idea | Source | What to build |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **Levels = overlay** | Leah: "The levels kind of overlay on this." "So the levels are an overlay." | Level layer is **toggleable**. Shown *after* the base map is understood — "at the end of the conversation" you can turn it on to see where a leveling guide fits. |
| **Rainbow blobs, not boxes** | Leah: "this other kind of rainbow here... It's this kind of blobby space." | Levels are **soft, large blobs that cut across the whole map** — diagonal bands, semi-transparent, overlapping. Not rigid boxes. |
| **Dots = where my work lives** | Leah: "Some of my work falls here. Some of it's over here..." | **Future:** Let a person plot **multiple dots** on the map (projects, moments). One person can exist in several places at once. |
| **Squiggle connects the dots** | Implied | The squiggle is the personal journey thread connecting those dots. |
| **Emotional unlock** | — | Someone can exist in **multiple places** on the map at once (different projects, different days) — that's **normal, not broken**. |
