# Metro Career Map — Rich Context (Q&A)

**What this is:** Answers from Ellen that define who this is for, what success looks like, what to avoid, and what must be real. Use this when making product or copy decisions. Every word in the UI is load-bearing.

**Canonical full brief:** See **`metro-map/METRO_FULL_BRIEF.md`** for the complete Project Metro reframe, tool description, tone, and required copy in one place.

---

## 1. Who is the primary user of this tool?

**Priority order:**
1. **Leah and the People team** — using it to explain Metro to skeptical ICs and managers.
2. **Brady and Ellen** — using it to pressure-test the framework in working sessions.
3. **Eventually:** Individual contributors at Grammarly mapping their own squiggle.

**Right now it's a storytelling tool, not a self-serve one.**

---

## 2. What context will they be in when they use it?

Laptop, shared screen, or Figma embed in a meeting. **Not mobile. Not a slide deck.** It needs to hold up in a **live conversation** where Leah is talking through it while someone else is watching — so it has to be **responsive to clicks and feel alive, not static.**

---

## 3. What are the one or two moments this tool needs to absolutely nail?

1. **The Shishir unlock:** The moment when someone sees both Expert poles side by side and says *"oh — those are both valid, they just look totally different."*
2. **The squiggle moment:** The moment when an IC draws their own squiggle and feels **relief instead of shame**. The tool earns trust by making the messy path look **intentional, not broken.**

---

## 4. What does success look like?

- **Short term:** Leah uses it in the Shishir pitch and **doesn't have to explain it** — it explains itself.
- **Longer term:** Someone sends a screenshot of their squiggle to their manager and it **starts a real conversation.**
- **Metric:** Not adoption. Whether it **changes the quality of career conversations.**

---

## 5. What should this tool explicitly avoid?

- No Radford language, no band/level jargon, no checklist energy.
- Don't make the blobs look like boxes.
- Don't make any path look objectively better than another — **visual hierarchy has to be neutral** across all four paths.
- Avoid anything that looks like a performance review or a promotion rubric.
- No "where do you want to be in 5 years" vibes.

---

## 6. What words or phrases are banned?

"Leveling." "Band." "Competency." "High performer." "Trajectory." Anything that sounds like it came from a comp spreadsheet. **The framework lives or dies on whether it feels human.**

---

## 7. What content must be real and grounded?

- The **four path types** need to come from **Leah's actual whiteboard language**, not invented personas.
- **Axis labels are fixed:**  
  - **Y:** Problem / Solution / How to Do / Execution  
  - **X:** Complexity · Scope · # of Directs · Amount of Ambiguity
- The **two Expert poles** are non-negotiable anchors: one is the person who has mastered execution at scale; the other is the person who can identify and frame the right problem. **Both are labeled "Expert."** That's the point.

---

## 8. What quotes or phrases must appear?

- **"When the business wins, I win"** — Expert orientation, not a loyalty statement. Show up near the Expert zone.
- **"Your squiggle"** — possessive, not clinical.
- **"Two very different looks. Both Expert."** — headline for the dual-pole moment.

---

## 9. What's the personal stake here?

**Ellen's:** Leah needs to walk into the Shishir meeting with something that **proves the team didn't just understand the framework intellectually — they built on it.** The tool is the proof of concept. If it lands, it validates the whole philosophical shift Metro is trying to make. **If it feels like a diagram someone threw together, it undermines the pitch.**

---

## 10. What additional context will actually help someone build this?

The framework is trying to do something hard: **convince people that ambiguity in a career path is a feature of growth, not a bug.** The tool's **emotional job** is to make that argument **visually before Leah even speaks.**

- The **squiggle path** has to look **interesting and dynamic** — not like someone got lost.
- The **Expert poles** have to feel like **two equally legitimate destinations.**
- The **axis labels** matter because they're the **vocabulary shift** Metro is trying to install — "Problem" instead of "scope creep," "Execution" instead of "IC work."
- **Every word in the UI is load-bearing.**

## Reference examples (interactive career / leveling tools)

*Searched 2026-02-19. Use for look/feel and UX ideas; avoid their jargon and “ladder” framing.*

| Example | What it is | Useful for Metro? | Avoid |
|--------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| **[Interactive Engineering Ladders](https://interactive-engineering-ladders.pages.dev/)** | Pentagon radar: 5 dimensions (influence, people, system, process, technology), levels 1–7, role types. Interactive sliders; shareable URLs. | **Yes:** Multi-axis, interactive, “not a single ladder.” Clean, minimal. | Their words are full ladder/level/band energy; we keep our axis labels and no level numbers. |
| **[Jobtrees](https://www.jobtrees.com/tree)** | Tree of real career paths from real profiles; toggle by role family. | **Maybe:** “Real paths people took” = same spirit as “your squiggle.” | Very job-title/org; we stay abstract (paths as shapes, not titles). |
| **[Tailoredpath](https://tailoredpath.com/)** | Map: jobs as points, distance = skill similarity. Explore by moving around. | **Maybe:** Map metaphor, 2D space, “you are here” feeling. | Occupation/salary focus; we’re about ownership and ambiguity, not jobs. |
| **[Progression](https://progression.co/features/frameworks/)** | Build custom career frameworks (positions, skills, levels); share and download. | **Maybe:** Polished, “framework as product.” | Built for bands/competencies; we explicitly avoid that. |
| **[FLOW Career Path](https://flowcareerpath.com/)** | Design-career tool: pick discipline, current level, target level; see requirements. | **Maybe:** Clean, role-specific. | Level-based; we don’t do “current level” or checklist. |
| **[AC4D Career Journey Map](https://impact.ac4d.com/career-journey-map/)** | Activity: “Your path hasn’t been a straight line — and that’s where the insight lives.” Map key moments and patterns. | **Yes:** Messaging is aligned (non-linear = insight). Good emotional framing. | Gated; we don’t know the exact interaction. Steal the *feeling*, not the format. |
| **[MyCareerMap.ai](https://mycareermap.ai/)** | “Metro-style” career map; AI suggestions, steps, skills. | **Maybe:** Literally “metro” metaphor; could inspire visual metaphor only. | Likely level/skills/checklist; we don’t want that. |

**Takeaways for Metro:**  
- **Interactive Engineering Ladders:** Strong reference for “multi-axis + interactive + shareable” and clean UI; swap their dimensions for PSHE + scope/ambiguity and drop level numbers.  
- **AC4D:** Use the “not a straight line” / “that’s where the insight lives” emotional frame; our squiggle should feel like that.  
- **Overall:** Steal “feels alive, not static” and “neutral across paths”; reject anything that looks like bands, levels, or rubrics.

- **Codrops / StorytellingMap:** Path draws onto the map (animate with stroke-dasharray / stroke-dashoffset), not pop in. Path as hero, journey feel.
- **Mobbin:** Polish and product feel; sharp, thoughtful product team.
- **Josh Comeau:** Smooth Bézier curves; path animation via getTotalLength(), stroke-dasharray, stroke-dashoffset.
