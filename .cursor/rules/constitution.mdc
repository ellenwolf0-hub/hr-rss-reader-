# Build principles

When writing or changing code in this project:

- **Simple, readable code** — clarity over cleverness. Avoid unnecessary abstraction.
- **Small functions** — one clear responsibility per function; split when logic grows.
- **Minimal dependencies** — add a new library only when the benefit clearly outweighs the cost.
