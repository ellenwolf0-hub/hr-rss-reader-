## Learning & Development

- **[The World Is Accelerating: What Has Changed About Leadership?](https://joshbersin.com/2026/02/the-world-is-accelerating-what-have-we-learned-about-leadership/)** — *Josh Bersin Blog*
  • Traditional authority-based leadership is giving way to a 'voluntary army' model where trust, empowerment, and mission clarity are the key levers for retaining and motivating employees who 'opt in' every day.
  • Leaders must shift from a perfectionist mindset to an iterative one — AI adoption requires comfort with imperfection and rapid experimentation rather than waiting for flawless solutions.
  • Declining institutional trust places greater responsibility on organizational leaders to model ethics, inclusion, and transparency, filling the gap left by eroding public confidence in institutions.
  • Bersin's research underscores that investing in leadership development is now a critical organizational capability — the ability to adapt in an AI-accelerated world is directly tied to leadership quality.

- **[New Research: How AI Transforms $400 Billion Of Corporate Learning](https://joshbersin.com/2026/02/new-research-how-ai-transforms-400-billion-of-corporate-learning/)** — *Josh Bersin Blog*
  • New Bersin research finds 74% of companies are not keeping up with their organization's demand for new skills, despite $400 billion in annual corporate training spend.
  • Traditional static/course-based learning models are becoming obsolete; AI-native platforms that generate and share content dynamically represent a fundamental shift from "training" to "Dynamic Enablement."
  • A four-level L&D Maturity Model is introduced, with Level 4 (AI-native learning) showing companies are 10x more likely to be innovation leaders, 6x more likely to exceed financial targets, and 16x more likely to adapt well to change.
  • Early adopters of AI-native learning platforms are seeing up to 40-50% reductions in internal L&D spend, while enabling faster content creation, decentralized delivery, and learning embedded directly into everyday workflows and tools.


## Workplace Experience & HR Tech

- **[The Great Reinvention of Human Resources Has Begun](https://joshbersin.com/2026/01/the-great-reinvention-of-human-resources-has-begun/)** — *Josh Bersin Blog*
  • Josh Bersin argues HR is undergoing an AI-driven reinvention in 2026, shifting from administrative overhead to a strategic 'full-stack' model as agentic AI takes over routine processes.
  • An estimated 30–40% of current HR jobs (e.g., interview schedulers, recruitment coordinators, helpdesk roles) can be automated with relatively low effort, while new AI orchestration and advisory roles will emerge.
  • The HR-to-employee ratio may shift dramatically—from the traditional 100:1 benchmark to 200:1, 300:1, or even 400:1—as AI handles tactical work, potentially driving up HR salaries for remaining strategic roles.
  • Data quality, AI bias, and trust are now core HR responsibilities; recent lawsuits against Workday and Eightfold underscore the need for explainable, high-integrity AI systems.


## DEI

- **[Perilous Times for Black Women in the U.S. Workforce&nbsp;](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/dei/articles/perilous-times-for-black-women-in-the-us-workforcenbsp?utm_medium=RSS)** — *HR Exchange Network (Articles)*
  • Black women in the U.S. workforce are facing increasing challenges, with systemic barriers impacting their career advancement and workplace equity.
  • The article highlights the heightened risks Black women face in the current economic and political climate, including potential rollbacks of DEI initiatives.
  • People Teams should audit their talent practices—hiring, promotion, pay equity—to ensure Black women are not disproportionately disadvantaged.
  • HR leaders are encouraged to proactively protect and sustain DEI commitments to support the retention and advancement of Black women employees.
